## Initial impressions (day 1)

- the hardware is georgous, like seriously an incredibly well-built and nice device
- typing on the type cover is fabulous, feels like a real keyboard.

## Initial setup notes

What I did after taking it out of the box and turning it on:

- inital setup wizard offered to give me "express settings", I said no and glad I did, allowed me to turn off some data-sharing stuff I didn't want that would have been on by default. I think this is available in settings later on, but read these things carefully next time.
- signed in with my microsoft account (should I have used a local account?)
  - bonus: I'd previously set up 2fa, and was prompted upon (inital) sign-in
  - didn't turn on Hello (#3)
- opted to use OneDrive (#4)
- no Cortana
- OS was up-to-date out of the box, no updates needed to be installed (cool!)
- installed Chrome, lastpass
  - yubikey just worked (including u2f)

## random ongoing notes junk

- the Slack app for Windows is super-ugly
